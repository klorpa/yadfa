A diaperfur/babyfur themed text adventure/rpg game I'm working on, you play it by typing in Lisp functions, similar to those text adventure games you play by typing in commands, but in Lisp form

Right now, most of the core of the game is done, but is missing a lot of content, and I might need help thinking up content for the game.
