To compile, you need a decent CL implementation, a recent version of ASDF (newer versions fix a few bugs that affect my game) and QuickLisp

If you're on Windows, you probably want Clozure CL

https://ccl.clozure.com

The rest of the world will probably want Steel Bank Common Lisp

http://sbcl.org

Also, if you're on Windows, you need to install an X Server. VcXsrv is a pretty good one

https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv

I think the minimum version of ASDF required for this game is 3.3.2.4. You can download the latest version here

https://gitlab.common-lisp.net/asdf/asdf/tags

create a directory called "~/common-lisp". (In Windows, the equivelant of "~" is "C:\Users\$User") extract ASDF in there.

You will also need to install Quicklisp, which can be downloaded from here

https://www.quicklisp.org

After which, either place this repo in either "~/common-lisp", "~/quicklisp/local-projects", or create a text file called "$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/common-lisp/source-registry.conf.d/50-yadfa.conf" with the following in it

(:tree "$PATH_TO_THIS_REPOSITORY")

In Windows, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is set to "C:/Users/$User/AppData/Local/". Also, when setting the pathname, you need to use what the rest of the world uses as the directory separator, which is "/", Not what Windows uses, which is "\".

After which, either run "sbcl --script build.lisp mods" or "ccl -l build.lisp -- mods" to build

To generate the docs, run

sbcl --script run.lisp mods texi;makeinfo --html --no-split yadfa.texi;makeinfo --pdf --no-split yadfa.texi;makeinfo --no-split yadfa.texi

The game uses Declt for generating the docs, which only works in SBCL so far

To build with SLIME/SWANK support, run "sbcl --script build.lisp mods swank" or "ccl -l build.lisp -- mods swank", then run "./yadfa swank" to launch the game

To build with Sly/Slynk support, run "sbcl --script build.lisp mods slynk" or "ccl -l build.lisp -- mods slynk", then run "./yadfa slynk" to launch the game
