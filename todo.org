* TODO Make more use of the items in zones and enemies
  - Likewise for moves
* DONE add new move that pantses the enemy to embarrass them
* DONE update ~FAST-THICKNESS~ to handle ~NIL~ at the end of the list as well as not have to pass 0 all the time
* DONE create the ~YADFA-PROPS~ package and move props to it
* DONE move the change-the-baby function outside the YADFA package, possibly creating a new package for it
* TODO go through ~YADFA:HOME;CORE;BIN.LISP~ and add the option to specify type specifiers instead of just an ~UNSIGNED-BYTE~
* DONE have ~YADFA::SET-LOGICAL-PATHNAMES~ run when ~ASDF:CLEAR-CONFIGURATION~ is done
* DONE add generated maze
** DONE Create the functions that generate it
** DONE Connect them to the rest of the map
* DONE add hash table that can hold shared enemy spawn lists
* TODO add ~YADFA:ENSURE-EVENT~ function
* TODO add DEPTH keyword to ~YADFA-BIN:LST~ to optionally limit the amount of items printed to ~*STANDARD-OUTPUT*~
* DONE add NPC team members
  - the NPC team members should probably be initialized at the start of the battle and thrown away when the battle is over, as the team's controls for outside battle is mostly for characters you actually control, and the player won't really control these NPC team members.
* TODO actually test team npc members
  - I can do that when I add them to the storyline
* TODO add mission capability to the event system
* TODO change ~potty-on-toilet~ and ~potty-on-self-or-prop~ to be more extensible, possibly by defining more methods and having these return values to indicate whether it was used.
* DONE extend props to make them placable
